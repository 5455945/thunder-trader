<img src='https://github.com/solopointer/thunder-trader/blob/master/assets/thunder-trader.png' width=200><br>
Based on C++ 11, this project implements a quantitative trading system supporting high-frequency transactions. The system supports the following characteristics:
- **Flexibility**

    - Using plug-ins to support different quotations and trading interfaces, such as CTP, Femas, Dfitc and TWS in China.
    - Support multiple accounts and multiple strategies. Each strategy can use multiple quotes, and can place orders for multiple accounts.

- **Easy to use**

    - Support both linux and windows
    - C/S architecture
    - Client with graphical interface
    - The real-time tracing of the variables in the policy can be realized by "probe" and the display mode of the data can be customized.
    - Supporting the "intervention" of the strategy, by predefining some intervention actions, to achieve a fixed operation in the transaction process.

- **Efficiency**

    - C++ implementation
    - Asynchronous event driven

## Quit start
This preject is tested in following environment:
> * gcc 7.2 or 4.8.4
> * boost 1.58.0
> * centos7

Usage:
```
>cmake .
>make
>make install
>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/gcc/lib/:/path/to/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ; /path/to/thunder-trader /path/to/thunder-trader.conf 1

Then will see output like: 
Run.SystemNumber=1 [20181021T062516.546639]
```
If you use a customed gcc path, you should specify the /path/to/gcc/lib/, such as /opt/gcc7/lib64.

As the same, if you use a customed boost path, you should specify the /path/to/boost/lib, such as /opt/boost/lib.

The usage of thunder-trader is `./thunder-trader config_file.conf system_number`, .e.g. `./thunder-trader thunder-trader.conf 1`, the system_number is a customed int that indicate the process by onlyself. You should make sure that different thunder-trader process has different system_number. 

The reason of use a system_number will be illustrated in the document.

Then you can use the [Monitor](http://www.huyifeng.net/HFT-monitor.html) to connect the thunder-trader.
